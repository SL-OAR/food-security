# What is this Document for?

Using data collected through the Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative (SWaSI), the purposes of this report are to 1) estimate rates of food security and food worries among undergraduates at the University of Oregon (UO), 2) document and describe relationships between food security/worries and demographics/wellbeing factors among UO undergraduates, and 3) recommend actions.

# Who is SWaSI?

The [Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EYGngNV9N4NAqey6v0nLCE8BWvq-tG81LKh0w9UegmYwvA?e=OSzKue){target="_blank"} is:

* an educational program designed to improve wellbeing and success outcomes, particularly among historically marginalized populations (e.g., first-generation students, Black students) and to provide undergraduates and graduates with experiential learning opportunities doing research
* an assessment and evaluation program designed to gauge whether various programmatic activities, including but not limited to the ones internal to the Initiative itself, are meeting their stated goals
* an ongoing, multicohort, longitudinal research program designed to holistically understand institutional inputs to students’ wellbeing and success across their experience at the university

Better understanding better informs us, affording opportunities to improve institutional practices that support students’ learning and development and foster their achievement and persistence. Unlike many for-profit companies, which use data to sell people, this is a strategy that uses data to *empower* people.

The Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative is led by Brian Clark, Assistant Director of the [Office of Assessment and Research](https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/research){target="_blank"} in the [Division of Student Life](https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}. It is supported primarily by the Office of the Vice President for Student Life with integral support from units of the Division of Student Life -- the [Department of Physical Education and Recreation](https://rec.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, the [Erb Memorial Union](https://emu.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, and the [Office of the Dean of Students](https://dos.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"} -- and across campus from many and varied units in [Global Engagement](https://international.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, the [Office of the Provost](https://provost.uoregon.edu/), [Student Services and Enrollment Management](https://ssem.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, [UO Libraries](https://library.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}, and [Undergraduate Education and Student Success](https://uess.uoregon.edu/){target="_blank"}.

# What is Food Security? {#whatis}

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines [food security](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement.aspx){target="_blank"} as access to and ready availability of enough nutritionally adequate and safe food for an active, healthy life, and includes the assured ability to acquire food in socially acceptable ways (e.g., without scavenging, stealing, etc.). The UO Food Security Task Force defines food security as reliable access to healthy, nutritious, culturally appropriate food. The preceding definitions are conceptualized at an individual level or, at most, a household level. Although food security can be conceptualized at higher levels (see [Pinstrup-Andersen, 2009](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EWkt9lUNfRtKmjnQzv0Aqr4BYdcLgfhiERlFaxJ7PP7jFA?e=CYadEf){target="_blank"} for a brief discussion; see also [Jones et al., 2013](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EdV7RVBqpv1Jrr_VlcA4EsYBgjbcsCqLfoK4HPnsJtPuUA?e=NCjO2i){target="_blank"} for a comprehensive review), we adopt an individual-level definition in the present research.

In contexts other than the UO, there are several documented associations with food security. Higher socioeconomic status is associated with higher food security ([Coleman-Jensen et al., 2020](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/ESC2Wu_vSu5IrQFAhPcXYksBS4ipUP3GUVHYeB6RSpImJQ?e=MwJeKs){target="_blank"}). White households tend to be more food secure than Black or Hispanic households ([Coleman-Jensen et al., 2020](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/ESC2Wu_vSu5IrQFAhPcXYksBS4ipUP3GUVHYeB6RSpImJQ?e=MwJeKs){target="_blank"}). Women ([Graham et al., 2019](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EesQJQBiv35Aoc6XszwBt6YBDUbzU7JvbBm_Nz24MlYqRw){target="_blank"}) and people who identify as LGBT ([Gates, 2014](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EZJumJEiwyVNlNIxnBHwp_IBHEi2LagsGa2FVx5LjQYYOg){target="_blank"}) are disproportionately food insecure. Further, higher food security is associated with lower stress and rates of mental illness ([Martin et al., 2016](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/Ed4W0C3vilJPihy5hc5mOBEBdFn3wcCnOCUocyGH07HOqQ){target="_blank"}) as well as higher life satisfaction ([Graham et al., 2019](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EesQJQBiv35Aoc6XszwBt6YBDUbzU7JvbBm_Nz24MlYqRw){target="_blank"}) and overall psychological wellbeing ([MacNeil et al., 2020](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EXR43rwrEVNEp57IUKG-NAsBdQarwMbacTag-C8pSjAUtg){target="_blank"}). And related to the context of higher education, college students are less likely to be food secure relative to the general population ([Nazmi et al., 2019](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/ET9ATyzzI6lEoPMAD-t7nYABHXo5kOk6F2FN3qrdUgapuA){target="_blank"}).

In the context of the UO, we confirmed many of these associations over the past two years (Clark & Delgado-Riley, [2021](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/EfkdOClmEVVGlxQOd-okLuABrR6_CtsLaxglzTYb6wdLng?e=dYyfid){target="_blank"}; [2022](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/Eb_j6AwaaQRFjyL-2FdsLxsBY2cl-hIMx04EC5rcGQmQ7g?e=0wbEgs){target="_blank"}). The rates of food insecurity among UO undergraduates were `r round(sum(!is.na(df_2021$fs_desc_bin[df_2021$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2021$fs_desc_bin))*100,1)`% in `r cy_2021` and `r round(sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin[df_2122$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin))*100,1)`% in `r cy_2022`, double and nearly triple the national rate in 2021 of 10.2%, respectively; students of lower socioeconomic status, students of underserved racial/ethnic groups (Black, Native American/Alaskan, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander), and LGBTQIA+ students were less likely to be food secure; and being food secure was significantly associated with lower stress, less sadness, and higher life satisfaction, even after controlling for potentially confounding demographics.

## Brief Food Security and Worries Methods

This year, as with previous years, our approach to the data was a mixture of confirmatory and exploratory. We aimed to replicate and extend by:

* estimating rates of food security and food worries among undergraduates
* adding confidence intervals to the overall estimates of food security and food worries
* investigating whether previously observed associations between food security/worries and demographics/wellbeing factors among UO undergraduates remain
* reducing our set of demographics variables to ones that have been useful predictors in the past (binary sex/gender and residency status were dropped)
* letting the data drive decisions about use of control covariates
* focusing exclusively on US undergraduates due to continued low participation among international undergraduates
* providing contextualizing results from other data: estimates of increased food cost and National College Health Assessment and Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey estimates of food security among first-through-fourth-year US undergraduates at the UO
* expanding and improving basic needs data analysis
* improving demographics descriptives in the [Supplemental Method](#supmeth)

Aligning with the USDA definition of food security, we measured food security using USDA methods, and aligning with the UO Food Security Task Force definition, we used a measurement of food worries we created. To verify or explore relationships with demographics variables, we joined data from student records (mostly data from admissions applications). Demographics examined were gender identity/sexuality, race/ethnicity, global socioeconomic status, family social class, high school quality, parent education level, and transfer status. Measurements of stress, sadness, and life satisfaction routinely collected through the Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative were used for verifying associations between food security/worries and wellbeing constructs.

The **10-item** USDA food security module classifies [four levels](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/definitions-of-food-security/){target="_blank"} along a continuum of food security.

1. **High Food Security**: no problems, or anxiety about, consistently accessing adequate food
2. **Marginal Food Security**: problems at times, or anxiety about, accessing adequate food, but quality, variety, and quantity of food intake not substantially reduced
3. **Low Food Security**: reduced quality, variety, and desirability of diets, but quantity of food intake and normal eating patterns not substantially disrupted
4. **Very Low Food Security**: eating patterns disrupted, food intake reduced due to lack of money and other resources

These categories can be further subdivided as a binary variable: **Food Secure** (high & marginal food security) vs. **Food Insecure** (low & and very low food security). This binary approach was used in the present analyses.

The **4-item** food worry scale was created to fit the UO Food Security Task Force's definition of food security and tap the psychological aspect of food insecurity (i.e., ***worrying*** about food) better than the USDA food security module does (it includes only one such item). 

Each item had a 4-point scale (0 = *not at all*, 1 = *slightly*, 2 = *a moderate amount*, 3 = *a lot*). To make a binary variable similar to food security, scores across the four items were summed for each student. Total sums of zero were coded as **No Worries** and total sums greater than zero were coded as **Worries**.

The recall time frame for both the food security and food worries measurements was 12 months, which entailed a span from spring to spring (2022 to 2023, 2021 to 2022, and 2020 to 2021). National College Health Assessment (spring 2022) used a short, adapted form of the USDA module and Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey (winter 2023) used the same 10-item form of the USDA module that we used. Both NCHA and Hope had a 30-day recall time frame.

# Summary

Food security was measured using the **10-item** United States Department of Agriculture Food Security Module. Food worries were measured with a **4-item** scale of our own design. See [Food Security Measurement](#fs) for more detail.

* [Overall Estimates](#ofsw)
    + `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fs_desc_bin=="Secure"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin))*100)`% of first-through-fourth-year US undergraduates were food secure between spring `r cy_2022` and spring `r current_cy`.
        - Put the other direction, `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin))*100)`% were food *insecure*, which is almost quadruple the national rate in 2021 of 10.2% ([Coleman-Jensen et al., 2022](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/Ec1cJPZmXhBLpfu1SjBdZ3UBf2ZYqOt4TI_WnkiisSDvpQ?e=PZcpQA){target="_blank"}). **However, LGBTQIA+ students were likely oversampled this year. Because they tend to be less food secure than do other students, this appears to have inflated the overall estimated food insecurity rate by about 2 percentage points. Still,** <span style="font-weight:bold">`r stat_1((sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin))*100)-2)`</span>**% is a rather high rate of food insecurity.** In 2022, food insecurity among first-through-fourth-year US undergraduates at the UO was triple the national rate (`r stat_1(sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin[df_2122$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%), and in 2021 among first-through-third-year US undergraduates, it was double the national rate (`r stat_1(sum(!is.na(df_2021$fs_desc_bin[df_2021$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2021$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%). **However, the 2021 sample did not include fourth-years and students of underserved racial groups (Black, Native American/Alaskan, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) were undersampled. So, the overall rate in 2021 may have been an underestimate.**
    + `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc))*100)`% of first-through-fourth-year US undergraduates were worried about food between spring 2022 and spring 2023, which is about `r round((sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc))*100)-(sum(!is.na(df_2122$fw_bin_desc[df_2122$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2122$fw_bin_desc))*100),0)` points higher than the 2022 estimate (`r round(sum(!is.na(df_2122$fw_bin_desc[df_2122$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2122$fw_bin_desc))*100,1)`%) and about `r round((sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc))*100)-(sum(!is.na(df_2021$fw_bin_desc[df_2021$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2021$fw_bin_desc))*100),0)` points higher than the 2021 estimate (`r round(sum(!is.na(df_2021$fw_bin_desc[df_2021$fw_bin_desc=="Worries"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2021$fw_bin_desc))*100,1)`%).
* [By Demographics](#dfsw)
    + Socioeconomic status indicators and gender identity/sexuality (LGBTQIA+ vs. not LGBTQIA+) remained the best demographics predictors of food security and food worries.
    + Race/ethnicity does NOT account for unique variation in food security once other variables -- importantly, socioeconomic indicators -- are taken into account.
* [Wellbeing Consequences](#wfsw)
    + As expected, being food secure remains significantly associated with lower stress, less sadness, and higher life satisfaction, even after controlling for potentially confounding demographics.
    + As expected, being worried about food remains significantly associated with higher stress, more sadness, and lower life satisfaction, even after controlling for potentially confounding demographics.
* [Basic Needs Support](#bns)
    + In spring 2022, we introduced a general open-ended question: How can the UO better support your basic needs (food, housing, safety, belonging, self-esteem, fulfillment)?
       - Hearing from students in their own words humanizes their voices and dignifies their struggles.
       - Students' focus was on physiological needs (food, housing) over other needs (safety, belonging, esteem, fulfillment). The second most frequently used of all words in 2023 and 2022 was literally "food." Housing was also top-of-mind; the word "housing" was the 4th (tied with "people") and 13th (tied with "mental") most frequently used word in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
       - Multimethod content analysis suggested that students want inclusive access to nutritious food (more options and resources, including free or cheaper food and a better pantry situation); more affordable living situations (cheaper food and housing, lower tuition, more financial support); better mental health support (increased therapist availability, more supportive campus environment regarding nonclinical needs); and more opportunities for social interaction. And nontraditional (e.g., students who are parents, veterans) and neurodivergent students want more inclusive support inside (e.g., greater flexibility with attendance policies) and outside (e.g., social network development) the classroom.
       - Sentiment analysis suggested general positivity, but is likely underestimating the extent of negative sentiment. Some students *are happy* with the situation and largely *do trust* the institution to take steps to support satisfaction of their basic needs, even if not enough is currently being done to support satisfaction of them. **We should not let them down.** And, some students are *unhappy* with the situation and *distrust* the institution to take steps to support the satisfaction of their basic needs. **We should surprise them.**
* Validity (see also [Supplemental Method](#supmeth))
    + The USDA measurement has been [extensively tested](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/survey-tools/#technical) and has been [in use for a quarter century](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/history-background/).
    + Independent assessment shows that the USDA measurement tends to underestimate, not overestimate, the prevalence of food insecurity ([Gregory, 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00357-019-09344-2)).
    + Results from the 2022 administration of the National College Health Assessment and the 2023 administration of the Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey at the UO suggest that our results do not overestimate food insecurity. NCHA uses an adapted, shorter, and arguably less reliable version of the USDA module. Hope uses the same, 10-item form of the USDA module we use, though with a different recall time frame.
        - NCHA estimated first-through-fourth-year US undergraduate food insecurity in 2022 at `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(ncha$fs_desc_bin[ncha$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(ncha$fs_desc_bin))*100)`% (*n* = `r sum(!is.na(ncha$fs_desc_bin))`), compared to our estimate in 2022 of `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin[df_2122$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%.
        - Hope estimated first-through-fourth-year US undergraduate food insecurity in 2023 at `r stat_1(hope_hifi$perc[hope_hifi$cat=="overall"&hope_hifi$out=="fs"&hope_hifi$class=="Insecure"])`% (*n* = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(hope_df$fs_desc_bin)))`), which is only slightly lower than our estimate in 2023 of `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%. The estimates are almost exactly the same if 2 percentage points are deducted from our estimate for oversampling LGBTQIA+ students. 
        - Additionally, Hope's estimate of food insecurity among LGBTQIA+ students (`r stat_1(hope_hifi$perc[hope_hifi$cat=="LGBTQIA+"&hope_hifi$out=="fs"&hope_hifi$class=="Insecure"])`%), who are one of the more vulnerable groups according to our results, is also in line with ours (`r stat_1(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"&current_df$lgbtqia_desc=="LGBTQIA+"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$lgbtqia_desc=="LGBTQIA+"]))*100)`%).
    + Observed higher rates of food insecurity among college students, people with lower socioeconomic status backgrounds, people who identify as LGBTQIA+, people of Latin* ethnicity, and people of underserved racial groups (e.g., Black) all confirm associations documented by previous research as do observed associations between food security and stress, sadness, and life satisfaction (see [What is Food Security](#whatis) section above).
    + In our data, USDA measurement of food security is consistently correlated with our measurement of food worries (*r*~2023~ = `r stat_2(fsfw_2223_r[2,1])`, *r*~2022~ = `r stat_2(fsfw_2122_r[2,1])`, *r*~2021~ = `r stat_2(fsfw_2021_r[2,1])`), which is itself internally consistent ($\alpha$~2023~ = `r stat_2(fw_2223_a)`, $\alpha$~2022~ = `r stat_2(fw_2122_a)`, $\alpha$~2021~ = `r stat_2(fw_2021_a)`) and the patterns of relationships between food security/worries and demographics/wellbeing variables are largely consistent across years, meaning that measurements of food security and worries are reliable. Additionally, the fact that food security and worries share a little over half of their variances (*r*^2^~2023~ = `r stat_2(fsfw_2223_r[2,1]^2)`, *r*^2^~2022~ = `r stat_2(fsfw_2122_r[2,1]^2)`, *r*^2^~2021~ = `r stat_2(fsfw_2021_r[2,1]^2)`) means they measure related but distinct constructs.
    + It is reasonable to expect increased food insecurity (2023: `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%; 2022: `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin[df_2122$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2122$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%; 2021: `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(df_2021$fs_desc_bin[df_2021$fs_desc_bin=="Insecure"]))/sum(!is.na(df_2021$fs_desc_bin))*100)`%) in the absence of greater action to mitigate it, given that food costs have risen dramatically. Nationally, they increased 3.5% in 2020, 3.9% in 2021, and **a whopping 9.9% in 2022** -- and they are expected to rise 6% (+/-1%) across 2023 ([USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/)).
    + Although we do welcome it, doubts about the validity of our results are unlikely based on earnest methodological critique. Rather, such doubts are more likely rooted in the fact that the results are rather unflattering. Even discounting the 2023 food insecurity rate because of likely oversampling of LGBTQIA+ students, the rate is still quite high. It is highly unlikely that any reasonable amount of discounting will make the rate low enough to justify ignoring it or not acting on it.
* Action
    + Undergraduates at the UO experience food insecurity at a much higher rate than the national average, and that appears to be increasing. Certain populations of students are even more food insecure. Rather than brushing these results aside, we should do more to lower the rate.
    + Working against efforts to lower the rate, food costs have risen dramatically. Nationally, they increased 3.5% in 2020, 3.9% in 2021, and **a whopping 9.9% in 2022** -- and they are expected to rise 6% (+/-1%) across 2023 ([USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/)). Contextually, the 10-year moving average of food price inflation from 2012 to 2021 was only 2.1% in the metropolitan area of the continental US with the highest inflation: San Francisco ([USDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/food-price-environment-interactive-visualization/)). That is to say, current circumstances are cause for concern. With [stagnant wage growth](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/) for low wage jobs, like those undergraduates tend to have, it is and will continue to be difficult to make ends meet.
    + As food insecurity is consistently associated with lower wellbeing (more stressed, sadder, less satisfied with life), food security should be considered as an important antecedent condition of student wellbeing and success. If students do not have reliable access to healthy, nutritious food, they are unlikely to be well or to succeed.
    + It is critical that food security programming and services be directed toward students with lower socioeconomic status backgrounds. 
        - Programming and services directed toward LGBTQIA+ students, Latin* students, or students in underserved racial groups (Black, Native American/Alaskan, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) may be effective in their own right. However, such an approach alone will not address the whole problem, given that it appears to be more of a broad socioeconomic issue than it is a specifically gender identity/sexuality one or a racial/ethnic one. With that said, because gender identity/sexuality tends to account for significant variance in food security and worries above and beyond socioeconomic status indicators, it may be beneficial to target programming and services at LGBTQIA+ students in addition to students with lower socioeconomic status backgrounds.
        - In open responses regarding basic needs support, LGBTQIA+ students raised a particular problem, namely that the food pantry is operated by a church. Given the national climate of discrimination against and dehumanization of LGBTQIA+ people, often by the religious right, it is not surprising that LGBTQIA+ students, who are one of the more vulnerable populations in terms of food security, may want to avoid religion-based resources. Perhaps establishment of a secular food pantry might be pursued.
    + Studying food security and worries addresses one of many needs people have. The Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative helps us on this front, heavily emphasizes another (belonging), and might be leveraged to at least partly address two others (self-esteem and fulfillment/self-actualization). However, it cannot measure everything. To more holistically understand and support students' needs, the Student Wellbeing and Success Initiative itself needs more support and there needs to be more support for developing the nexus of knowledge through emphasis on studying other need domains.
        - For example, among first-through-fourth-year US undergraduates at the UO, the Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey estimated housing insecurity in 2023 at `r stat_1(hope_hifi$perc[hope_hifi$cat=="overall"&hope_hifi$out=="hs"&hope_hifi$class=="Insecure"])`% and homelessness at `r stat_1(hope_hifi$perc[hope_hifi$cat=="overall"&hope_hifi$out=="hmls"&hope_hifi$class=="Homeless"])`%, which are both slightly higher among LGBTQIA+ students (Housing Insecure: `r stat_1(hope_hifi$perc[hope_hifi$cat=="LGBTQIA+"&hope_hifi$out=="hs"&hope_hifi$class=="Insecure"])`%; Experiencing Homelessness: `r stat_1(hope_hifi$perc[hope_hifi$cat=="LGBTQIA+"&hope_hifi$out=="hmls"&hope_hifi$class=="Homeless"])`%).

# Overall Estimates {#ofsw}

Food security was measured using the **10-item** United States Department of Agriculture Food Security Module. Food worries were measured with a **4-item** scale of our own design. See [Food Security Measurement](#fs) for more detail.

It may be reasonable to **decrease** the estimated food insecurity (increase food security) rate **by 2 percentage points**, given likely oversampling of LGBTQIA+ students. <span style="color: #B63679FF">Pink</span> error bars represent the 95% confidence interval around the estimated percentage. Calculation of error applied a small, finite population [correction](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/6/6.3) using the following expression: 1.96 * sqrt(((proportion * (1 - proportion)) / Sample *n*) * (Source *N* - Sample *n*) / (Source *N* - 1)) * 100, where Source *N* in this case was `r big_n(source_n_2223)` admitted, active status, first-through-fourth-year, US undergraduates during spring 2023. Numerically, the confidence interval for both food secure and insecure was +/- `r stat_1(fs_ci$ci[fs_ci$ay==2223&fs_ci$cat=="Secure"])` percentage points and the confidence interval for both food worries and no worries was +/- `r stat_1(fs_ci$ci[fs_ci$ay==2223&fs_ci$cat=="Worries"])` percentage points. Plots were produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` and `magma` palettes of the `viridis` package.

#### Gender Identity/Sexuality

LGBTQIA+ students were marginally less likely to be food secure (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_lgbtqia$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_lgbtqia$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_lgbtqia$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_lgbtqia$coefficients[2,4])`) and significantly more likely to be worried about food (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_lgbtqia$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_lgbtqia$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_lgbtqia$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001) than were those who were not LGBTQIA+.

Note: *n*~*Food Security*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[!is.na(current_df$lgbtqia_desc)])))` (*n*~*LGBTQIA+*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$lgbtqia_desc=="LGBTQIA+"])))`, *n*~*Not LGBTQIA+*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$lgbtqia_desc=="Not LGBTQIA+"])))`); *n*~*Food Worries*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[!is.na(current_df$lgbtqia_desc)])))` (*n*~*LGBTQIA+*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$lgbtqia_desc=="LGBTQIA+"])))`, *n*~*Not LGBTQIA+*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$lgbtqia_desc=="Not LGBTQIA+"])))`). Regressions were computed using the `glm` function with gender identity/sexuality dummy coded as *Not LGBTQIA+* = 0, *LGBTQIA+* = 1. Plots were produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` palette of the `viridis` package.

#### Race/Ethnicity

Latin* students were marginally less likely to be food secure than was the average student (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,4])`). Asian (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,4])`), Multiracial/ethnic (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,4])`), and Underserved (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,4])`) students did not differ significantly on food security compared to the average student.  However, small group size may have obscured some real differences. The odds of Asian students being food secure were 45% greater than those of the average student (*OR* = `r stat_2(exp(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,1]))`), the odds of Multiracial/ethnic students being food *insecure* were 46% greater than those of the average student (*OR* = `r stat_2(1/exp(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,1]))`), and the odds of Underserved students -- Black, Native American/Alaskan, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander -- being food *insecure* were 75% greater than those of the average student (*OR* = `r stat_2(1/exp(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,1]))`). Conversely and illustratively, Latin* students were the largest group and their effect size was bordering on being substantial (*OR* = `r stat_2(1/exp(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,1]))`), like their p-value was bordering on being significant (*p* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,4])`).

Asian (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[2,4])`), Latin* (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[3,4])`), Multiracial/ethnic (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[4,4])`), and Underserved (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_re$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_re$coefficients[5,4])`) students did not differ significantly on food worries compared to the average student.

Note: We **occasionally edit** labels to be more contemporary and inclusive. For example, we **recently updated** to use _Latin_\* "to serve as a deliberate intervention—a pause for readers to consider the various ways in which people from Latin American origin and diaspora in the United States may identify" ([Salinas, 2020](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EQETPZ91zUVNsMZni6786RYBvUNYP0mzEzfMDWsPzqQhNQ?e=5iNhLx); see also [Lozano et al., 2021](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/Ecyy9Kpj99dDhWRP9QQIXT8BfrCfqG17HMEpHCt-85020Q?e=cudLKL)). *n*~*Food Security*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[!is.na(current_df$re_reduced)])))` (*n*~*Asian*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_reduced=="Asian"])))`, _n_~_Latin_\*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_reduced=="Latin*"])))`, *n*~*Multiracial/ethnic*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_reduced=="Multiracial/ethnic"])))`, *n*~*Underserved*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_reduced=="Underserved"])))` [`r round(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_desc=="Black"])) / sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_reduced=="Underserved"]))*100,0)`% Black], *n*~*White*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$re_reduced=="White"])))`); *n*~*Food Worries*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[!is.na(current_df$re_reduced)])))` (*n*~*Asian*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_reduced=="Asian"])))`, _n_~_Latin_\*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_reduced=="Latin*"])))`, *n*~*Multiracial/ethnic*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_reduced=="Multiracial/ethnic"])))`, *n*~*Underserved*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_reduced=="Underserved"])))` [`r round(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_desc=="Black"])) / sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_reduced=="Underserved"]))*100,0)`% Black], *n*~*White*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$re_reduced=="White"])))`). Regressions were computed using the `glm` function with race/ethnicity being weighted effects coded ([J. Cohen et al., 2003](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-18109-000){target="_blank"}) with *White* as the base category, which means that *Asian*, _Latin_\*, *Multiracial/ethnic*, and *Underserved* are compared to "the average student," weighted by group size. Plots were produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` palette of the `viridis` package.

#### Global Socioeconomic Status

Students of higher socioeconomic status were significantly more likely to be food secure (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_sss$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_sss$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_sss$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001) and significantly less likely to be worried about food than were students of lower socioeconomic status (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_sss$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_sss$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_sss$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001).

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
fs_plot_2223_sss

```

Note: *n*~*Food Security*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[!is.na(current_df$sss_desc_bin)])))` (*n*~*Lower*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$sss_desc_bin=="Lower"])))`, *n*~*Middle*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$sss_desc_bin=="Middle"])))`, *n*~*Upper*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$sss_desc_bin=="Upper"])))`); *n*~*Food Worries*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[!is.na(current_df$sss_desc_bin)])))` (*n*~*Lower*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$sss_desc_bin=="Lower"])))`, *n*~*Middle*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$sss_desc_bin=="Middle"])))`, *n*~*Upper*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$sss_desc_bin=="Upper"])))`). Regressions were computed using the `glm` function with global socioeconomic status retaining its full ordinal scale (1-10, corresponding to rungs on a ladder; see [Supplemental Method](#supmeth) for details). For depicting results, the scale was condensed to three ordinal categories: Lower (1 through 4, which was approximately -1SD), Middle (5 through 7), and Upper (8, which was approximately +1SD, through 10). Plots were produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` palette of the `viridis` package.

#### Family Social Class

Students whose families are of higher social class were significantly more likely to be food secure (*b* = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_fsc$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fs_model_2223_fsc$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fs_model_2223_fsc$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001) and significantly less likely to be worried about food than were students whose families are of lower social class (*b* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_fsc$coefficients[2,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(fw_model_2223_fsc$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_fsc$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(fw_model_2223_fsc$coefficients[2,4])`). 

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
fs_plot_2223_fsc

```

Note: *n*~*Food Security*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[!is.na(current_df$fsc_desc_bin)])))` (*n*~*Lower*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fsc_desc_bin=="Lower"])))`, *n*~*Middle*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fsc_desc_bin=="Middle"])))`, *n*~*Upper*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fs_desc_bin[current_df$fsc_desc_bin=="Upper"])))`); *n*~*Food Worries*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[!is.na(current_df$fsc_desc_bin)])))` (*n*~*Lower*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$fsc_desc_bin=="Lower"])))`, *n*~*Middle*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$fsc_desc_bin=="Middle"])))`, *n*~*Upper*~ = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(current_df$fw_bin_desc[current_df$fsc_desc_bin=="Upper"])))`). Regressions were computed using the `glm` function with family social class retaining its full ordinal scale (1 = *Working Class*, 2 = *Lower-Middle Class*, 3 = *Middle Class*, 4 = *Upper-Middle Class*, 5 = *Upper Class*). For depicting results, the scale was condensed to three ordinal categories: Lower (*Working Class* and *Lower-Middle Class*), Middle (*Middle Class*), and Upper (*Upper-Middle Class*, and *Upper Class*). Plots were produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` palette of the `viridis` package.

#### High School Quality

## Accounting for Unique Variation {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade #mpm}

Food security was measured using the **10-item** United States Department of Agriculture Food Security Module. Food worries were measured with a **4-item** scale of our own design. See [Food Security Measurement](#fs) for more detail.

#### Current Results -- `r current_cy`

When demographics predictors of food security that were significant or at least substantial (gender identity/sexuality, race/ethnicity, global socioeconomic status, family social class, high school quality, parent education level, transfer status) were all entered into one model, only **family social class** (*b* = `r stat_2(sig_pred_mod_fs_2223$coefficients[8,1])`, *z*(`r big_n(sig_pred_mod_fs_2223$df.residual)`) = `r stat_2(sig_pred_mod_fs_2223$coefficients[8,3])`, *p* = `r stat_2(sig_pred_mod_fs_2223$coefficients[8,4])`) **remained significant**.

The nonsignificant predictors that were nonetheless of substantial size were the comparisons of Asian students to the average student and Underserved students to the average student. The odds of Asian students being food secure were more than twice those of the average student (*OR* = `r stat_2(exp(sig_pred_mod_fs_2223$coefficients[3,1]))`) and the odds of Underserved students being food *insecure* were 46% greater than those of the average student (*OR* = `r stat_2(1/exp(sig_pred_mod_fs_2223$coefficients[6,1]))`).

There were two nonsignificant predictors that were nonetheless of substantial size: the comparison of Underserved students to the average student and parent education level. Both coefficients *reversed direction* in the multiple-predictor model, meaning that when other variables were accounted for, Underserved students were *more* likely to be food secure than was the average student and first-generation students were *more* likely to be food secure than were continuing-generation students. Specifically, the odds of Underserved students being food secure were 59% greater than those of the average student (*OR* = `r stat_2(exp(sig_pred_mod_fs_2021$coefficients[6,1]))`) and the odds of first-generation students being food secure were 53% greater than those of continuing-generation students (*OR* = `r stat_2(exp(sig_pred_mod_fs_2021$coefficients[11,1]))`). **These results suggest the model may be untrustworthy.**

### Stress

Students who were food secure were significantly less stressed (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ps_fs_2223$fit_1$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ps_fs_2223$fit_1$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ps_fs_2223$fit_1$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001). This relationship remained significant (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ps_fs_2223$fit_2$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ps_fs_2223$fit_2$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ps_fs_2223$fit_2$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001) after controlling for gender identity/sexuality, global socioeconomic status, family social class, and high school quality, which were potential confounding variables given their relationships with both stress and food security.

Students who were worried about food were significantly more stressed (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ps_fw_2223$fit_1$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ps_fw_2223$fit_1$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ps_fw_2223$fit_1$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001).

Note: Means depicted are from controlled models (<span style="color: #B63679FF">Pink</span> error bars represent 95% confidence intervals around means). Control covariates were chosen based on zero-order relationships between demographics and food security/worries and between demographics and stress. **Food security** and **food worries** were predictors of interest in separate models. **Control covariates** for food security and worries models were **gender identity/sexuality** (dummy coded -- *Not LGBTQIA+* = 0, *LGBTQIA+* = 1), **global socioeconomic status** (ordinal scale: 1-10, corresponding to rungs on a ladder; see [Supplemental Method](#supmeth) for details), **family social class** (ordinal scale: *Working Class* = 1, *Lower-Middle Class* = 2, *Middle Class* = 3, *Upper-Middle Class* = 4, *Upper Class* = 5), and **high school quality** (weighted effects coded with *Equally Advantaged* as the base category, which means that *Less Advantaged* and *More Advantaged* are compared to "the average student," weighted by group size). Regressions were computed using the `lm` function. Model predicted means and 95% confidence intervals were computed using the `emmeans` package. Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` and `magma` palettes of the `viridis` package.

Note: Means depicted are from controlled models (<span style="color: #B63679FF">Pink</span> error bars represent 95% confidence intervals around means). Control covariates were chosen based on zero-order relationships between demographics and food security/worries and between demographics and sadness. **Food security** and **food worries** were predictors of interest in separate models. **Control covariates** for food security and worries models were **gender identity/sexuality** (dummy coded -- *Not LGBTQIA+* = 0, *LGBTQIA+* = 1), **global socioeconomic status** (ordinal scale: 1-10, corresponding to rungs on a ladder; see [Supplemental Method](#supmeth) for details), and **high school quality** (weighted effects coded with *Equally Advantaged* as the base category, which means that *Less Advantaged* and *More Advantaged* are compared to "the average student," weighted by group size). Regressions were computed using the `lm` function. Model predicted means and 95% confidence intervals were computed using the `emmeans` package. Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `viridis` and `magma` palettes of the `viridis` package.

#### Life Satisfaction

Students who were food secure were significantly more satisfied with life (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fs_2021$fit_1$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ls_fs_2021$fit_1$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fs_2021$fit_1$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001). This relationship remained significant (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fs_2021$fit_2$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ls_fs_2021$fit_2$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fs_2021$fit_2$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001) after controlling for gender identity/sexuality, global socioeconomic status, family social class, and high school quality, which were potential confounding variables given their relationships with both life satisfaction and food security, and race/ethnicity, parent education level, and transfer status, which were used as precision control covariates given their relationships with life satisfaction but not food security.

Students who were worried about food were significantly less satisfied with life (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fw_2021$fit_1$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ls_fw_2021$fit_1$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fw_2021$fit_1$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001). This relationship remained significant (*b* = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fw_2021$fit_2$coefficients[2,1])`, *t* (`r mod_ls_fw_2021$fit_2$df[2]`) = `r stat_2(mod_ls_fw_2021$fit_2$coefficients[2,3])`, *p* < 0.001) after controlling for gender identity/sexuality, race/ethnicity, global socioeconomic status, family social class, high school quality, and parent education level, which were potential confounding variables given their relationships with both life satisfaction and food worries, and transfer status, which was used as a precision control covariate given its relationship with life satisfaction but not food worries.

# Basic Needs Support {#bns}

## Current Results -- `r current_cy` {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade #bn}

### Hierarchy of Needs

Students had the most to say about **physiological needs**. A total of `r bn_food_2223` students (`r stat_1((bn_food_2223/length(bn_2223$bn))*100)`%) explicitly mentioned the word "**food**" `r bn_clnr_dtm_2223$freq[bn_clnr_dtm_2223$word=="food"]` times. A total of `r bn_housing_2223` students (`r stat_1((bn_housing_2223/length(bn_2223$bn))*100)`%) explicitly mentioned the word "**housing**" `r bn_clnr_dtm_2223$freq[bn_clnr_dtm_2223$word=="housing"]` times. These frequencies *underestimate* the extent to which students are writing about housing or food issues, given that many other words can be and are used to describe housing of food issues. Still, "food" is the second most frequently used word and "housing" is the fourth most frequently used word, *overall*, which puts both domains of issues top-of-mind.

The problem is that **some students struggle to afford** food or housing. A large portion (`r stat_1(bn_fin_2223/length(bn_2223$bn)*100)`%) of students mentioned financially related terms (`r bn_freq_fin_2223` instances). About one out of six (`r stat_1(bn_pay_2223/bn_fin_2223*100)`%) of them mentioned the terms "pay," "paid," or "wage." About one in five (`r stat_1(bn_union_2223/bn_pay_2223*100)`%) of those specifically mentioned unionization efforts.

Students mentioned all **other domains of [Maslow's hierarchy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html)** but much less frequently. A total of `r bn_safe_2223` students (`r stat_1((bn_safe_2223/length(bn_2223$bn))*100)`%) mentioned some version of the word "safe" `r sum(bn_clnr_dtm_2223$freq[str_detect(bn_clnr_dtm_2223$word,"safe")])` times. A total of `r bn_belong_2223` students (`r stat_1((bn_belong_2223/length(bn_2223$bn))*100)`%) mentioned some version of the word "belong" `r sum(bn_clnr_dtm_2223$freq[str_detect(bn_clnr_dtm_2223$word,"belong")])` times. A total of `r bn_esteem_2223` students (`r stat_1((bn_esteem_2223/length(bn_2223$bn))*100)`%) mentioned the word "esteem" `r bn_clnr_dtm_2223$freq[bn_clnr_dtm_2223$word=="esteem"]` times. A total of `r bn_fulfill_2223` students (`r stat_1((bn_fulfill_2223/length(bn_2223$bn))*100)`%) mentioned some version of the word "fulfill" `r sum(bn_clnr_dtm_2223$freq[str_detect(bn_clnr_dtm_2223$word,"fulfil")])` times.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

```

Note: The "Physiological" category combines mentions of the terms "food" and "housing." Percentages were computed dividing the number of students who mentioned a given term (or terms in the case of "Physiological") by the number of responses used in analysis and multiplying by 100. Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `magma` palette of the `viridis` package.

### Content Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

#### Themes

A group of students (*n* = `r bn_good_2223`) felt that their basic needs were being supported well by UO, acknowledged their privilege that their needs were otherwise satisfied, or felt that their own need satisfaction was their personal responsibility and not the university's. However, a staggering number of students were struggling with meeting their needs or saw room for improvement in the university's support systems (*n* = `r length(bn_2223$bn)`, `r stat_1(length(bn_2223$bn)/length(current_df$id_eoy23)*100)`% of the sample). Students were candid and shared how they thought the UO could improve, which we summarized in four categories of themes: 1. inclusive access to nutritious food, 2. general affordability, 3. mental health support, and 4. inclusive support. Themes can be thought of as both conclusions we drew from what students told us and recommendations to staff and faculty for action.

**Inclusive access to nutritious food**: Other than struggling with food prices, students wanted healthier foods (e.g., fresh fruits and vegetables) and more options that allow them to balance variety with navigating food allergies and sensitivities (e.g., gluten-free, dairy-free). Providing nutritious, dense, staple foods (e.g., legumes) would be healthy and avoid many allergies/sensitivities, as well as be religiously and culturally appropriate. Additionally, students were disappointed that there is no food pantry on campus (LGBTQIA+ students were disappointed that the current pantry is in a church), they would like more resources to support the Ducks Feeding Ducks program, and they want dining halls and other food vendors to be open later. 

**General affordability**: Students were struggling to make ends meet due to rising cost of not only food, but also of housing and tuition. Students had difficulty paying for expensive meal plans. Students who used SNAP benefits wanted to use them at UO vendors, especially at the EMU, but could not. Figuring out a way students could use SNAP benefits on campus would be beneficial. Many students were working multiple jobs, frustrated with low wages of on-campus jobs, and called for more subsidies and financial aid support so that they could meet their and their families' needs, given rising costs. One student brought up an excellent point that the UO may be underestimating cost of living which may adversely affect financial aid packages.

**Mental health support**: Therapist availability may not be meeting demand and students are seeking longer-term care and support. Students felt that a more supportive campus environment regarding nonclinical mental health needs, especially regarding attitudes among staff and faculty, would help them cope and manage the challenges they are experiencing.

**Inclusive support**: Nontraditional students (e.g., students who are parents, veterans) and neurodivergent students wanted more inclusive support inside (e.g., greater flexibility with attendance policies) and outside (e.g., social network development) the classroom. 

There were other threads that crossed categories:

1. Woven throughout students' responses was a desire for better communication about resources throughout the academic year. Many students mentioned that they did not know about resources available at the UO. **How might we more intentionally and strategically communicate about available resources to students? Might resources be included in course syllabi or disseminated via Canvas?**
2. A consistent thread through all four categories was the need for normalizing that students are struggling and they need help. Students feel strongly that if understanding their needs is more normalized, this will help with their senses of belonging, self-esteem, and fulfillment.
3. Students want to feel that the UO genuinely cares about them and their wellbeing, and some currently feel that expressions of such care are false.

Note: Themes can be thought of as both conclusions we drew from what students told us and recommendations to staff and faculty for action. Responses were open-coded using Grounded Theory ([Strauss & Corbin, 2006](https://www.abebooks.com/Basics-Qualitative-Research-Grounded-Theory-Procedures/31086127519/bd); [Tracy, 2019](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Qualitative+Research+Methods%3A+Collecting+Evidence%2C+Crafting+Analysis%2C+Communicating+Impact%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119390800)), which is a framework used to understand people’s experiences by building on themes from qualitative data they provide. Table was produced using the `huxtable` package.

#### Wordnet

There are some interesting threads in the 2-to-3-term clusters of the network depiction of adjacent adjectives and nouns below, but the main stories are in the big cluster on the left side and in the 5-term string below it. Students are concerned about food security and want more options and resources, including free or cheaper food and a better pantry situation. Students are also concerned about rising housing costs and want more affordable, accessible housing options. They also want lower tuition and more support through and better access to financial and mental health resources and opportunities for social interaction.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_bigram_2223
```

Note: Wordnet = adjacent ($\le$ 1 word apart) adjective-noun bigrams visualized as a network. Line **thickness** represents **frequency** of cooccurrence. The criterion for inclusion of bigram in the wordnet was cooccurrence $\gt$ 3 (min = `r bn_cmm_2223[1,1]`, max = `r bn_cmm_2223[1,2]`). If a word seems positively valenced, it may have been negated (e.g., preceded by the word "not"). Text data were annotated using the `udpipe` package. Wordnet was generated using the `ggraph` and `igraph` packages. 

#### Wordcloud

Keywords extracted and displayed in the wordcloud below largely confirm the descriptions in the Hierarchy of Needs, Themes, and Wordnet sections. Students are struggling to make ends meet and want more tangible support of their physiological needs, particularly food and housing.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_cloud_2223
```

Note: Word **size** represents **frequency** of keyword occurrence. **Hover over** words to see frequencies. The criterion for inclusion of a keyword in the wordcloud was occurrence $\gt$ 3. If a word seems positively valenced, it may have been negated (e.g., preceded by the word "not"). Text data were annotated using the `udpipe` package. Keywords were extracted using the Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm ([Rose et al., 2010](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/Eda0fgvF1VJAn2PPEU3c0xIBTrkNJIEnzOUzQhz6zaT5IA?e=FeHDYB){target="_blank"}). Wordcloud was generated using the `wordcloud2` package.

#### Quotes

> "Better educate people on where to find the resources."

> "Tell students that you care and actually mean it."

> "I know this will never be listened to, but there is no moral argument for tuition being as high as it is, especially considering the pay that is now promised to college grads is basically still poverty wages. Please stop pretending to care. Lower tuition.

___
___
___

> "I think allowing more food options for people with UO meal plans and lowering the cost of simple food items would help extremely."

> "Have more fruit and vegetable options in the dining halls or lower the number of points they cost so you can get more of them for your room."

> "There needs to be more options for those with food allergies or sensitivities that are not super expensive or cost a lot of points."

> "Food resources for my peers: accept SNAP in the EMU, construction of a new pantry that is not in a church, food recovery program for dining hall food waste."

> "Bring back Ducks Feeding Ducks being 3 times per term."

> "It would be extremely helpful if all dining halls were open until 9pm. Just that one extra hour would benefit many students because people have work, classes, and other commitments that stop them from having a well-rounded dinner."

___
___
___

> "I found myself running out of meal points during every single finals week. I had to use my limited real money to pay for food."

> "The price of a food plan is outrageous and the stores on campus are so overpriced. So, students without means of transportation have to pay more. Given how much we pay for tuition and for everything else at the UO, it should be cheaper for students, not more expensive."

> "It is crazy how expensive everything is. As a full-time student, it is hard to afford college itself, let alone everything else that has to be bought along with it."

> "Housing is extremely expensive in Eugene and tuition continues to get more expensive. I highly doubt the university will do anything about this but paying my tuition and housing is a big part of why I could not afford enough food some months."

> "I think housing and food should cost less on the UO campus. A lot of students are struggling to survive on their own without the support of their parents. So, making housing and dining halls more more financially accessible would benefit everyone."

> "Cut the price. If I can get a fully furnished apartment for $900 a month in Eugene then there is no reason for dorms to be this expensive. Dorms are supposed to be the cheap option. If three people are paying $1,500 a month on a room then that room better be worth $4,500 a month."

> "Raise the estimated cost of attendance to accommodate realistic living expenses for nontraditional students. This is typically about $1,500 to $2,000 per month when on a budget. Gas, insurance, and car cost $500 per month. Owning a car is not a lifestyle choice; it a necessity for anyone who has to work or has family members to support. Rent for a single bedroom is usually more than $1,000 per month here. Utilities cost $200 per month in the cold months. Food is at the very minimum $300 per month. So, a total of $24,000 per year is a very modest estimate and assumes zero extra expenses: technology, clothes, other essentials. So, why is the estimated cost just under $19,000? Living on that amount of money for the year is only possible for mostly white students who are supported by family in some way. Please just raise this estimate so we can feed ourselves while here.

> "Pay your student workers a living wage not the minimum wage, and stop trying to sabotage the student workers union. It is the most cringe thing I have seen the university do all year. It makes you look evil. It makes me want to tell high schoolers to stay away from the university."

___
___
___

> "Increase the number of counseling sessions at the Counseling Center or allow counselors to accept outside insurance."

> "Having more than just six free counseling sessions per term would be super helpful to students who need weekly services and can not afford or access off campus services."

> "A long term option for counseling would be great. I have utilized the counseling services but all they could recommend was other offices for long term aid. I have since been on a waiting list for a few months in an attempt to get help but have had no luck with outside providers."

> "Some professors have had a hard time understanding that I need to take days to look after my mental health and are pretty unforgiving with deadlines and attendance policies."

> "It's significant when professors address and act towards the mental and physical wellbeing of students. So, continued support to give them awareness and tools to help makes a positive difference."

> "The UO needs to ensure that professors and GEs have the capacity to give their students the attention they deserve. I have had numerous professors that were incredibly helpful but others have struggled to understand situations of duress I was under, and as a result my academic performance suffered greatly."

___
___
___

> "The reason the absence policy is disastrous for nontraditional students is that it makes it impossible for teachers to work with students who have extenuating circumstances. The policy makes it feel like the UO is geared toward kids straight out of high school who have their parents paying for everything."

> "There should be more services for students as parents. All organizations should have events at more varied or for longer lasting times. I often cannot attend things I want to because of children, work, or school duties."

> "I think there should be more inclusive spaces and programming for nontraditional students. I did not get the first-year experience because it was tailored toward traditional students."

> "It would be nice if there was some way for socially anxious, awkward people like myself to meet others like them. I have found that socially, anxious, awkward people tend to get along better with people like themselves rather than more outgoing people."

### Sentiment Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

#### Valence

Although sentiments were more positive than negative, the portion of negative sentiments are quite substantial and should not be written off. Across three methods used to classify valence of sentiments, almost a third (`r stat_1(mean(bn_sent_2223$val$perc[bn_sent_2223$val$Valence=="Negative"]))`%) of sentiments expressed were negative on average. Also, dealing with negation (e.g., "not good" is negative) in sentiment analysis is notoriously difficult. The methods used here did not attempt to do anything about negation. As such, we are *underestimating* the extent of negative sentiment.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_val_plot_2223
```

Note: Percentage = the percentage of words classified as positive or negative (Valence). Three lexicons (Method) were used via the `tidytext` package to classify valence of sentiments: `afinn` ([Nielsen, 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2903){target="_blank"}), `bing` ([Hu & Liu, 2004 ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1014052.1014073){target="_blank"}), and `nrc` ([Mohammad & Turney, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6297.pdf){target="_blank"}). Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `magma` palette of the `viridis` package.

#### Emotion

Consistent with classification of sentiment valence, specific emotions expressed were more positive (trust, joy, anticipation) than negative (sadness, fear, anger, disgust). Again, this should not be taken as license to write off negative expressions. However, it should be taken as an indication that some students *are happy* with the situation and largely *do trust* the institution to take steps to support satisfaction of their basic needs, even if not enough is currently being done to support satisfaction of them. **We should not let them down.** And, because nothing was done here to handle negation (e.g., "not good" is negative), we are *overestimating* the extent of *positive* emotions, meaning, for example, that some students are *unhappy* with the situation and *distrust* the institution to take steps to support the satisfaction of their basic needs. **We should surprise them.**

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_emo_plot_2223
```

Note: Emotions are presented in rank order from most to least prevalent. Percentage = the percentage of words classified as one of eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust), based on [Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion](https://doi.org/10.1177/053901882021004003){target="_blank"} (see [Plutchik's Wheel](#wheel)). The `nrc` lexicon ([Mohammad & Turney, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6297.pdf){target="_blank"}) via the `tidytext` package was used to classify emotional content of sentiments. Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `magma` palette of the `viridis` package.

## Previous Results {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

### `r cy_2022` {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade #bn}

#### Hierarchy of Needs

Students had the most to say about **physiological needs**. A total of `r bn_food_2122` students (`r stat_1((bn_food_2122/length(bn_2122$bn))*100)`%) explicitly mentioned the word "**food**" `r bn_clnr_dtm_2122$freq[bn_clnr_dtm_2122$word=="food"]` times. A total of `r bn_housing_2122` students (`r stat_1((bn_housing_2122/length(bn_2122$bn))*100)`%) explicitly mentioned the word "**housing**" `r bn_clnr_dtm_2122$freq[bn_clnr_dtm_2122$word=="housing"]` times. These frequencies *underestimate* the extent to which students are writing about housing or food issues, given that many other words can be and are used to describe housing of food issues. Still, "food" is the second most frequently used word and "housing" is the thirteenth most frequently used word, *overall*, which puts both domains of issues top-of-mind.

The problem is that **many students struggle to afford** food or housing. A large portion (`r stat_1(bn_fin_2122/length(bn_2122$bn)*100)`%) of students mentioned financially related terms (`r bn_freq_fin_2122` instances). About one out of six (`r stat_1(bn_pay_2122/bn_fin_2122*100)`%) of them mentioned the terms "pay," "paid," or "wage."

Students mentioned all **other domains of [Maslow's hierarchy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html)** but much less frequently. A total of `r bn_safe_2122` students (`r stat_1((bn_safe_2122/length(bn_2122$bn))*100)`%) mentioned some version of the word "safe" `r sum(bn_clnr_dtm_2122$freq[str_detect(bn_clnr_dtm_2122$word,"safe")])` times. A total of `r bn_belong_2122` students (`r stat_1((bn_belong_2122/length(bn_2122$bn))*100)`%) mentioned some version of the word "belong" `r sum(bn_clnr_dtm_2122$freq[str_detect(bn_clnr_dtm_2122$word,"belong")])` times. A total of `r bn_esteem_2122` students (`r stat_1((bn_esteem_2122/length(bn_2122$bn))*100)`%) mentioned the word "esteem" `r bn_clnr_dtm_2122$freq[bn_clnr_dtm_2122$word=="esteem"]` times. A total of `r bn_fulfill_2122` students (`r stat_1((bn_fulfill_2122/length(bn_2122$bn))*100)`%) mentioned some version of the word "fulfill" `r sum(bn_clnr_dtm_2122$freq[str_detect(bn_clnr_dtm_2122$word,"fulfil")])` times.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_mhn_plot_2122
```

Note: The "Physiological" category combines mentions of the terms "food" and "housing." Percentages were computed dividing the number of students who mentioned a given root term that covers its variations (e.g., "safe" also covers "safety," "safely," "safer," "safest," and "unsafe") or set of distinct terms (i.e., "food" or "housing" for physiological) by the number of responses used in analysis and multiplying by 100. Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `magma` palette of the `viridis` package.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_val_plot_2122
```

Note: Percentage = the percentage of words classified as positive or negative (Valence). Three lexicons (Method) were used via the `tidytext` package to classify valence of sentiments: `afinn` ([Nielsen, 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2903){target="_blank"}), `bing` ([Hu & Liu, 2004 ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1014052.1014073){target="_blank"}), and `nrc` ([Mohammad & Turney, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6297.pdf){target="_blank"}). Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `magma` palette of the `viridis` package.

##### Emotion

Consistent with classification of sentiment valence, specific emotions expressed were more positive (trust, joy, anticipation) than negative (sadness, fear, anger, disgust). Again, this should not be taken as license to write off negative expressions. However, it should be taken as an indication that some students *are happy* with the situation and largely *do trust* the institution to take steps to support satisfaction of their basic needs, even if not enough is currently being done to support satisfaction of them. **We should not let them down.** And, because nothing was done here to handle negation (e.g., "not good" is negative), we are *overestimating* the extent of *positive* emotions, meaning, for example, that some students are *unhappy* with the situation and *distrust* the institution to take steps to support the satisfaction of their basic needs. **We should surprise them.**

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bn_emo_plot_2122
```

Note: Emotions are presented in rank order from most to least prevalent. Percentage = the percentage of words classified as one of eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust), based on [Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion](https://doi.org/10.1177/053901882021004003){target="_blank"} (see [Plutchik's Wheel](#wheel)). The `nrc` lexicon ([Mohammad & Turney, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6297.pdf){target="_blank"}) via the `tidytext` package was used to classify emotional content of sentiments. Plot was produced using the `ggplot2` package. Colors were produced using the `magma` palette of the `viridis` package.

# Supplemental Method {#supmeth}

## Sources, Sizes, and Characteristics

SWaSI end-of-year check-in data collection happens in the latter half (weeks 6 through 10) of every spring term. Food security/worries and wellbeing data came from the spring `r current_cy`, `r cy_2022`, and `r cy_2021` waves of that. Measurements of core (ability uncertainty, belonging uncertainty, loneliness, social support, stereotype threat, general health, **life satisfaction**, **stress**, self-assurance, **sadness**) and other (**food security**, **food worries**, place-based belonging, etc.) constructs were block randomized in presentation. Demographics data (gender identity, sexuality, etc.) were collected at the end.

Recruitment procedures shifted in spring 2022. Instead of following up with participating students longitudinally by emailing them across the second half of each spring term -- this is why 2021 analyses excluded fourth-year students -- the end-of-year check-in effectively became cross-sectional and various campus units and individual colleagues promoted the survey through various communications media. By collecting identifiers, we are still able to cobble together multiple data sources and time points.

SWaSI baseline data collection happens every summer prior to matriculation. Some demographics data from baseline were used here. Global socioeconomic status, family social class, and high school quality were exclusively from baseline SWaSI. Gender identity/sexuality from baseline SWaSI were used to fill missing data from end-of-year check-in. And parent education level from baseline SWaSI were used to fill missing data from admissions records.

Demographics data came from:

* admissions data only (race/ethnicity, transfer status)
* baseline SWaSI data only (global socioeconomic status, family social class, high school quality)
* end-of-year + baseline SWaSI data (gender identity/sexuality) -- missingness in given end-of-year wave is filled with baseline data
* admissions data + baseline SWaSI data (parent education level) -- missingness in admissions data is filled with baseline SWaSI data.

Additional food security data came from the National College Health Assessment administered in spring 2022. Additional food security data as well as housing security and homelessness data came from the Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey administered in winter 2023.

### SWaSI Data

Totals of *n* = `r big_n(base_n$n[base_n$ayear==2223])` and *n* = `r big_n(base_n$n[base_n$ayear==2122])` admitted, first-through-fourth-year, US undergraduates who contributed at least one usable datum in spring `r current_cy` and `r cy_2022` end-of-year check-ins, respectively, and *n* = `r big_n(base_n$n[base_n$ayear==2021])` admitted, first-through-third-year, US undergraduates who contributed at least one usable datum in spring `r cy_2021` were considered potential participants. Samples for overall estimates of food security/worries were reduced by missing food security/worries data. Missing data has been increasing due to increased survey noncompletion, which is likely partly due to changes in recruitment methods implemented starting in 2022 and to a syndrome known as survey fatigue.

#### Overall Sample Size and Percent Missing

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
fs_n_and_perc_missing
```

Note: Table produced using the `huxtable` package.

After filtering out cases that had no data on either food security or food worries, there were missing data in demographics and wellbeing variables that lowered sample sizes for any given subsequent analysis. By how much sample sizes were lowered depended on model and data source.

#### Model Sample Size {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}

For consistency, uncontrolled and controlled models of wellbeing consequences excluded cases missing data on outcomes of interest (stress, sadness, life satisfaction), predictors of interest (food security, food worries), and relevant control covariates.

##### `r current_cy`

Single-predictor models using data that included demographics from only admissions data (race/ethnicity, transfer status) had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2223&mod_n$mod=="sp"&mod_n$dsrc=="adm"]),0))`. Single-predictor models using data that included demographics from only baseline SWaSI data (global socioeconomic status, family social class, high school quality) had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2223&mod_n$mod=="sp"&mod_n$dsrc=="bl"]),0))`. Single-predictor models using data that included demographics from end-of-year + baseline SWaSI data (gender identity/sexuality primarily relied on end-of-year data and when missing was filled with baseline data when available) had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2223&mod_n$mod=="sp"&mod_n$dsrc=="bleoy"]),0))`. Single-predictor models using data that included demographics from admissions + baseline SWaSI data (parent education level primarily relied on admissions data and when missing was filled with baseline SWaSI data when available) had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2223&mod_n$mod=="sp"&mod_n$dsrc=="admbl"]),0))`. Multiple-predictor models using data had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2223&mod_n$mod=="mp"]),0))`. Wellbeing consequences models using data had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2223&mod_n$mod=="wb"]),0))`.

##### `r cy_2022`

Single-predictor models using data that included demographics from only admissions data (race/ethnicity, transfer status) had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2122&mod_n$mod=="sp"&mod_n$dsrc=="adm"]),0))`. Single-predictor models using data that included demographics from only baseline SWaSI data (global socioeconomic status, family social class, high school quality) had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2122&mod_n$mod=="sp"&mod_n$dsrc=="bl"]),0))`.

Multiple-predictor models using data had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2122&mod_n$mod=="mp"]),0))`. Wellbeing consequences models using data had an average sample size of *n* = `r big_n(round(mean(mod_n$n[mod_n$ay==2122&mod_n$mod=="wb"]),0))`.

### Descriptives

#### Reference Data

Population-level reference data were used in various ways in plots of overall food security and worries [estimates](#ofsw) and demographics descriptives (below).

For demographics data that come only from admissions data (race/ethnicity and transfer status), population percentages were calculated and presented alongside sample percentages. 

For demographics data that exist only in SWaSI data (gender identity/sexuality, global socioeconomic status, family social class, and high school quality), a small, finite population [correction](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat415/lesson/6/6.3) was applied to calculation of uncertainty, depicted as error bars representing 95% confidence intervals, around sample estimates of percentages. The correction used the following expression:

$1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{N_{Sample}} \times \frac{N_{Source} - N_{Sample}}{N_{Source} - 1}} \times 100$

Source *N* was the total population number of admitted, active status, first-through-fourth-year, US undergraduates during spring 2023 (*N* = `r big_n(source_n_2223)`) and spring 2022 (*N* = `r big_n(source_n_2122)`), or admitted, active status, first-through-third-year, US undergraduates during spring 2021 (*N* = `r big_n(source_n_2021)`).

For parent education level, which exists in both admissions data and baseline SWaSI data, population and sample percentages were calculated for admissions data, survey data, and combined data (see [this section](#demos) for combination procedure) and presented alongside each other. The SWaSI baseline survey is not technically population-level, but samples are so large it can be reasonably treated as such for comparison to much smaller end-of-year samples. And in that respect, admissions data for parent education level are not technically population-level either, given substantial missingness, which is why we use a combination of the data sources.

### NCHA Data

A total of *n* = `r length(ncha$fs_desc_bin)` first-through-fourth year US undergraduates participated in the National College Health Assessment in spring 2022 (*n* = `r sum(!is.na(ncha$fs_desc_bin))` had valid data on food security).

### Hope Data

A total of *n* = `r big_n(length(hope_df$fs_desc_bin))` first-through-fourth year US undergraduates participated in the Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey in winter 2023 (*n* = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(hope_df$fs_desc_bin)))` had valid data on food security, *n* = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(hope_df$hs_bin_desc)))` had valid data on housing security, and *n* = `r big_n(sum(!is.na(hope_df$hmls_bin_desc)))` had valid data on homelessness). Hope's sample was `r stat_1(sum(!is.na(hope_df$lgbtqia_desc[hope_df$lgbtqia_desc=="LGBTQIA+"]))/sum(!is.na(hope_df$lgbtqia_desc))*100)`% LGBTQIA+, which suggests that SWaSI likely oversampled LGBTQIA+ students in spring 2023 and that 2022 and 2021 samples are likely more representative with respect to that demographic.

## Measurement and Analysis

### Food Security {#fs}

#### SWaSI

The United States Department of Agriculture food security module was implemented in end-of-year check-in waves according to screening methodology. 

##### Implementation

<br>

**First, students were presented with the following instructions:**

<br>

![](fs0.png){width=4in}

<br>

___

___

![](fs1.png){width=4in}

<br>

**Next, students were presented with the first set of items:**

<br>

![](fs2.png){width=4in}

<br>

![](fs3.png){width=4in}

<br>

![](fs4.png){width=4in}

<br>

**If responses to any of the items in the first set were** ***often true*** **or** ***sometimes true***, **students were presented with the second set of items:**

<br>

![](fs5.png){width=4in}

<br>

**If the response to the above item was "yes," students were presented with the intermediate followup item below before moving onto the subsequent three items in the second set.**

<br>

![](fs5.1.png){width=3in}

<br>

![](fs6.png){width=4in}

<br>

![](fs7.png){width=4in}

<br>

![](fs8.png){width=4in}

<br>

**If responses to any of the four yes/no items in the second set was "yes," students were presented with the following item:**

<br>

![](fs9.png){width=4in}

<br>

**If response to the above item was "yes," students were presented with the followup item below.**

<br>

![](fs9.1.png){width=3in}

<br>

##### Classification

For each of the 10 items, affirmative responses (i.e., often true, sometimes true, yes, almost every month, several months but not every month) were scored as 1 and negative responses (i.e., never true, no, don’t know, only 1 or 2 months) were scored as 0. Then items were summed, for a possible total score range of 0 to 10. (Students who responded in the negative to the first three items automatically had a total score of 0, because of the screening methodology.) Total score ranges were classified as follows:

* 0 – High Food Security
* 1-2 – Marginal Food Security
* 3-5 – Low Food Security
* 6-10 – Very Low Food Security

High and Marginal were combined to form the Secure category while Low and Very Low were combined to form the Insecure category.

#### NCHA

##### Implementation

The National College Health Assessment used an adapted version of the short-form of the United States Department of Agriculture food security module, which employed a 30-day time frame:

* For the following statements, please say whether the statement was often true, sometimes true, or never true for you in the last 30 days. 
    + The food that I bought just didn't last, and I didn't have money to get more (response options: *Never True*, *Sometimes True*, *Often True*)
    + I couldn't afford to eat balanced meals. (response options: *Never True*, *Sometimes True*, *Often True*)
* In the last 30 days, did you ever cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn’t enough money for food? (response options: *No*; *Only 1 or 2 days*; *Yes, some days, but not every day*; *Yes, almost every day*)
* In the last 30 days, did you ever eat less than you felt you should because there wasn't enough money for food? (response options: *No*, *Yes*)
* In the last 30 days, were you ever hungry but didn't eat because there wasn't enough money for food? (response options: *No*, *Yes*)

##### Classification

For each of the 5 items, affirmative responses (i.e., Sometimes True; Often True; Yes, some days, but not every day; Yes, almost every day; Yes) were scored as 1 and negative responses (i.e., Never True, Only 1 or 2 months, No) were scored as 0. Then items were summed, for a possible total score range of 0 to 5. Total score ranges were classified as follows:

* 0-1 – High/Marginal Food Security
* 2-4 – Low Food Security
* 5 – Very Low Food Security

High/Marginal formed the Secure category while Low and Very Low were combined to form the Insecure category.

The National College Health Assessment data were provided with precomputed food security scores and classifications. However, the method is questionable. It appears that *Only 1 or 2 days* responses were counted as affirmative (i.e., scored as 1) and *Yes, some days but not every day* and *Yes, almost every day* responses were counted twice (i.e., scored as 2), perhaps because it is a combination of a yes/no question and a frequency question from the original module. Both these alterations substantially change the measurement. The second (doubling) alteration may be legitimate, but the 1st (*Only 1 or 2 days* as affirmative) is inconsistent with USDA scoring guidelines. Without psychometric validation of either alteration, this scoring procedure seems unjustifiable. It almost certainly overestimates food insecurity. Hence, we computed a 0-5 sum score based on the criteria described at the beginning of this subsection and kept the same classification ranges (albeit scores of 6 are not part of the Very Low Food Security range). This scoring is likely to, at worst, underestimate food insecurity and, at best, estimate it accurately.

#### Hope

##### Implementation

Like SWaSI, Hope used the 10-item United States Department of Agriculture food security module. The differences in implementation between Hope and SWaSI were:

1. Hope used a 30-day time frame rather than 12-month.
2. Hope did not include response options in the first set of items (i.e., the first set of items did not include "Was that often true, sometimes true, or never true for you in the last 12 months?" after the statement to which people were responding). This is a very reasonable adaptation we may adopt in future measurement through SWaSI.
3. Hope's phrasing of the "how often" follow-up questions was different (e.g., "In the last 30 days, how often did this happen (you cut the size of your meals or skipped meals because there wasn't enough money for food)?" rather than "How often did you cut the size of your meals or skip meals because there wasn't enough money for food?"). We prefer our adaptation to theirs.
4. Response options for the "how often" follow-up questions were also different (*Once*, *Twice*, *Three times*, *Four times*, *Five times*, *More than five times*). This difference is largely a function of recall time frame.
5. An additional set of food security items were presented to students who are parents (see below for items).

##### Classification

Because of their extra parent-related items, Hope scored food security items differently depending on whether a student did or did not have children.

For students with no children, and consistent with SWaSI scoring, possible total scores ranged from 0 to 10 and each affirmative response counted as 1 point. Students with children answered a set of questions that pertained to feeding their children. Each affirmative response to the regular 10-item module counted as 1 point and affirmative responses to each of the following parenting-relevant questions got an additional point:

* I relied on only a few kinds of low-cost food to feed my child/children because I was running out of money to buy food.
* I couldn’t feed my child/children a balanced meal because I couldn’t afford that.
* My child/children were not eating enough because I just couldn’t afford enough food.
* In the last 30 days, did you ever cut the size of your child/children’s meals because there wasn’t enough money for food?
* In the last 30 days, were your child/children ever hungry but you just couldn’t afford more food?
* In the last 30 days, did your child/children ever skip a meal because there wasn’t enough money for food?
* In the last 30 days, did your child/children ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn’t enough money for food?
* In the last 30 days, how often did your child/children skip meals due to lack of money or food?

Total score ranges were classified as follows:

* Students with no children
    + 0 – High Food Security
    + 1-2 – Marginal Food Security
    + 3-5 – Low Food Security
    + 6-10 – Very Low Food Security
* Students with children
    + 0 – High Food Security
    + 1-2 – Marginal Food Security
    + 3-7 – Low Food Security
    + 8-18 – Very Low Food Security

High and Marginal were combined to form the Secure category while Low and Very Low were combined to form the Insecure category.

### Food Worries

#### Implementation

Students were presented with the items below using the following response/coding options (*not at all* = 0, *slightly* = 1, *a moderate amount* = 2, *a lot* = 3).

* In the last 12 months, how much have you worried about having reliable access to food.
* In the last 12 months, how much have you worried about getting enough food.
* In the last 12 months, how much have you worried about being able to afford food.
* In the last 12 months, how much have you worried about having nutritious food.

#### Classification

Items were summed, for a possible total score range of 0 to 12. Total scores were classified as 0 = No Worries and greater than 0 = Worries.

#### Scale Characteristics

Cronbach's alpha indicated good internal consistency (standardized $\alpha$s were `r stat_2(fw_2223_a)`, `r stat_2(fw_2122_a)`, and `r stat_2(fw_2021_a)` in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively). Average *r*s were slightly high (`r stat_2(fw_2223_ar)`, `r stat_2(fw_2122_ar)`, and `r stat_2(fw_2021_ar)` in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively) -- about 0.5 is optimal. Variability among correlations consistently indicated unidimensionality (*SD*s of *r*s were `r stat_2(fw_2223_sd)`, `r stat_2(fw_2122_sd)`, and `r stat_2(fw_2021_sd)` in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively). Total scores of food worries (i.e., 0-12 range, no worries to worries) were consistently and highly correlated with total scores of food security (i.e., 0-10 range, insecure to secure; *r*s were `r stat_2(fsfw_2223_r[2,1])`, `r stat_2(fsfw_2122_r[2,1])`, and `r stat_2(fsfw_2021_r[2,1])` in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively), indicating a high degree of similarity but not redundancy between the two metrics. That is, they share about half of their variances (*r*$^2$s were `r stat_2(fsfw_2223_r[2,1]^2)`, `r stat_2(fsfw_2122_r[2,1]^2)`, and `r stat_2(fsfw_2021_r[2,1]^2)` in 2023, 2022, 2021, respectively).

### Demographics {#demos}

**Gender identity/sexuality** was derived from two items: gender identity and sexual orientation. Data are collected at the end of both baseline and end-of-year check-in waves of SWaSI. Data from baseline were used to fill missing data from end-of-year waves.

For **gender identity**, students were asked "What is your gender identity? (select all that apply)." Response options changed in baseline for the 2020-21 cohort and again in end-of-year check-in in spring 2023. At baseline, among the 2018-19 and 2019-20 cohorts, response options were *Fluid*, *Gender Queer*, *Man*, *Transgender*, *Woman*, *None of these describe me well; this is better:*, and *Prefer not to respond*, in that order from top to bottom. At baseline, among the 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23 cohorts, options were *Agender*, *Genderqueer*, *Man*, *Nonbinary (including gender fluid, gender nonconforming, etc.)*, *Transgender*, *Trans Man*, *Trans Woman*, *Woman*, *Questioning or unsure*, *None of these describe me well; this is better:*, and *prefer not to respond*, in that order from top to bottom. In both versions, the *None of these describe me well; this is better:* and *prefer not to respond* options were mutually exclusive to the other options. At end-of-year check-in in spring 2023, response options were *Agender*, *Cisgender*, *Genderfluid*, *Gender nonconforming*, *Genderqueer*, *Man*, *Multigender (including bigender, polygender, pangender, etc.)*, *Nonbinary*, *Third Gender*, *Transgender*, *Two-Spirit*, *Woman*, *Questioning or exploring*, *Not listed (please specify):*, and *prefer not to respond*, in that order from top to bottom. In all versions, the *None of these describe me well; this is better:* or *Not listed (please specify):* option included an open text box for students to specify how they identified, most of which were coded as one or more of the existing categories. The small few that were truly unique were excluded from further categorization and analysis.

For **sexual orientation**, incoming students were asked "Which term best describes your sexual orientation?" The question changed from single-select to multi-select in baseline for the 2020-21 cohort, adding "(select all that apply)" to the item and response options changed in baseline for the 2020-21 cohort. Response options changed again in end-of-year check-in in spring 2023. At baseline, among the 2018-19 and 2019-20 cohorts, response options were *Asexual*, *Bisexual*, *Gay or Lesbian*, *Queer*, *Pansexual*, *Straight or heterosexual*, *None of these describe me well; this is better:*, and *prefer not to respond*, in that order from top to bottom. At baseline, among the 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23 cohorts, options were *Asexual*, *Bisexual*, *Gay*, *Heterosexual or straight*, *Lesbian*, *Pansexual*, *Queer*, *Questioning or unsure*, *Same-gender loving*, *None of these describe me well; this is better:*, and *prefer not to respond*, in that order from top to bottom. In both versions, the *None of these describe me well; this is better:* and *prefer not to respond* options were mutually exclusive to the other options. At end-of-year check-in in spring 2023, response options were *Asexual*, *Bisexual*, *Fluid or flexible*, *Gay*, *Graysexual*, *Heterosexual or straight*, *Lesbian*, *Pansexual*, *Queer*, *Questioning or exploring*, *Same-gender loving*, *Not listed (please specify):*, and *prefer not to respond*, in that order from top to bottom. In all versions, the *None of these describe me well; this is better:* or *Not listed (please specify):* option included an open text box for students to specify how they identified, most of which were coded as one or more of the existing categories. The small few that were truly unique were thus excluded from further categorization and analysis.

All categories of gender identity that were not exclusively *Man* or *Woman* were grouped together to form a *Nonbinary* category. All categories of sexuality that were not exclusively *Straight or heterosexual*/*Heterosexual or straight* were grouped together to form an *LGBQ+* category. Then, the *Nonbinary* and *LGBQ+* categories were grouped together to form *LGBTQIA+*. In analyses, *Not LGBTQIA+* was coded as 0 and *LGBTQIA+* was coded as 1.

**Race/ethnicity** data were obtained from admissions records. Prospective students were first asked to identify whether they are Hispanic or Latino (yes, no) and then were asked to identify racial categories that apply to them (*American Indian or Alaska Native*, *Asian*, *Black or African American*, *Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander*, *White*). If students selected "no" regarding ethnicity (i.e., whether they are *Hispanic or Latino*) and selected more than one racial category, they were categorized as "Two or more races," which corresponds to the *Multiracial/ethnic* category in this document. If they selected “yes” regarding ethnicity and selected at least one racial category, they were nonetheless categorized as *Hispanic or Latino*. To be more contemporary, inclusive, and efficient we relabeled *American Indian or Alaska Native* as *Native American/Alaskan*, *Black or African American* as *Black*, *Hispanic or Latino* as _Latin_\*, and *Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander* as *Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander*. The *Black*, *Native American/Alaskan*, and *Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander* categories were grouped together to form the *Underserved* category because there were too few participants in each of those groups to be analyzed on their own, and they are, in part demonstrated by their small numbers, legitimately labeled as underserved. In analyses, categories were weighted effects coded ([J. Cohen et al., 2003](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-18109-000){target="_blank"}) with *White* as the base category.

**Global socioeconomic status** data were collected at the end of the baseline wave of SWaSI, where incoming students were asked:

![](sgs.png){width=6in}

Note: See [Goodman et al. (2001)](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EWE85kc5xtJIidgpJoGfAaIBNC9hGjQ34HhzzMi7v5g0Eg?e=d6KshV){target="_blank"} for source of measurement. In analyses, responses were coded 1 through 10 corresponding to rungs on the ladder. In depicting results, the scale was condensed to three ordinal categories: Lower (1 through 4, which was approximately -1*SD*), Middle (5 through 7), and Upper (8, which was approximately +1*SD*, through 10). 

**Family social class** data were collected at the end of the baseline wave of SWaSI, where incoming students were asked "How would you describe your family's social class?" Response options were *Working Class*, *Lower-Middle Class*, *Middle Class*, *Upper-Middle Class*, and *Upper Class*, in that order from top to bottom. In analyses, responses were coded 1 through 5, from working to upper. In depicting results, the scale was condensed to three ordinal categories: Lower (*Working Class* and *Lower-Middle Class*), Middle (*Middle Class*), and Upper (*Upper-Middle Class*, and *Upper Class*).

**High school quality** data were collected at the end of the baseline wave of SWaSI, where incoming students were asked "How do you think the high school you attended compares to the high schools attended by most incoming UO students?" Response options were *My high school is less advantaged than the high schools attended by most other incoming students*, *My high school is neither less nor more advantaged than the high schools attended by most other incoming students*, and *My high school is more advantaged than the high schools attended by most other incoming students*, in that order from top to bottom. In analyses, responses were weighted effects coded ([J. Cohen et al., 2003](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-18109-000){target="_blank"}) with "neither" as the base category.

**Parent education level** data were a combination of admissions data and data collected at the end of the baseline wave of SWaSI. Admissions applications ask prospective students what their parents' education levels are (from the Common Application: *Some grade/primary school*, *Completed grade/primary school*, *Some high school/secondary school*, *Graduated from high/secondary school [or equivalent]*, *Some trade school or community college*, *Some college/university*, *Graduated from college/university*, *Graduate school*). At the end of the baseline wave of SWaSI, students were asked:

![](pel.png){width=7in}

Students who had at least one parent who "Graduated from college/university" or has a "4-year college / university degree" were considered *Continuing-Generation* and students who did not have any parents who "Graduated from college/university" or had a "4-year college / university degree" were considered *First-Generation*. Data from the baseline wave of SWaSI were used to fill data missing from admissions records. In analyses, *Continuing-Generation* was coded as 0 and *First-Generation* was coded as 1.

**Transfer status** data were obtained from admissions records. Students who were coming from another institution of higher education were considered *Transfer* and students who were coming from high school were considered *First-Time*. Transfer students were included in data collection starting with the 2018-19 cohort, which is the beginning of the year-in-school time frame for any analysis presented here. In analyses, *First-Time* was coded as 0 and *Transfer* was coded as 1.

### Wellbeing Constructs

**Stress** refers to the extent to which students feel able to control things in life, including handling difficulties as they arise ([S. Cohen et al., 1983](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EbaYmsAlVMlDjARKEZpiKAEBYId52um-cMRVORU73CFOng?e=idHL8s){target="_blank"}). It is measured with the items below using the following response coding/options: 1 = *never*, 2 = *almost never*, 3 = *sometimes*, 4 = *fairly often*, 5 = *very often*. Items were POMP-scored ([J. Cohen et al., 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327906MBR3403_2){target="_blank"}) to form a composite variable prior to analysis.

* In the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?
* In the last month, how often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?
* In the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?
* In the last month, how often have you felt difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?

**Sadness** refers to a cluster of students' feelings centered on emotional suffering and social isolation ([Watson & Clark, 1999](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EUtzl5RNY2pKsYfP9OykI8cBFboISwrcDAf4ESGU_fYPAw?e=K8SuFd){target="_blank"}). It is measured with the prompt "Indicate to what extent you have felt this way during the past month." and five emotion descriptors (sad, blue, downhearted, alone, lonely) as items using the following response coding/options: 1 = *very slightly or not at all*, 2 = *a little*, 3 = *moderately*, 4 = *quite a bit*, 5 = *extremely*. Items were POMP-scored ([J. Cohen et al., 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327906MBR3403_2){target="_blank"}) to form a composite variable prior to analysis.

**Life Satisfaction** refers to students' global judgments of how satisfactory their lives are in general ([Deiner et al., 1985](https://uoregon.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/SWaSI/EaXTvOVqyRBAttaOqa-ba0sBBu0x5jV_emWCSVCf_ToMMA?e=DXfOCI){target="_blank"}). It is measured with the items below using the following response coding/options: 1 = *strongly disagree*, 2 = *moderately disagree*, 3 = *slightly disagree*, 4 = *slightly agree*, 5 = *moderately agree*, 6 = *strongly agree*. Items were POMP-scored ([J. Cohen et al., 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327906MBR3403_2){target="_blank"}) to form a composite variable prior to analysis.

* In most ways, my life is close to my ideal.
* The conditions of my life are excellent.
* I am satisfied with my life.
* So far, I have gotten the important things I want in life.
* If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing.

### Basic Needs Support

#### Implementation

Starting in 2022, at the end of the end-of-year check-in survey, students were asked: How can the UO better support your basic needs (food, housing, safety, belonging, self-esteem, fulfillment)? They were provided with a essay text box to write their responses.

#### Analysis

Rows with no response at all were removed (*n*~2023~ = `r bn_na_2223`; *n*~2022~ = `r bn_na_2122`). Then, responses that were effectively nonresponses (e.g., "I don't know," "N/A," "none," "nothing") were removed (*n*~2023~ = `r bn_invalid_2223`; *n*~2122~ = `r bn_invalid_2122`). Finally, to focus on what could be improved and how, responses which indicated that students felt their basic needs were being supported well by UO, that their needs were otherwise satisfied, or felt that their own need satisfaction was their personal responsibility and not the university's were removed (*n*~2023~ = `r bn_good_2223`; *n*~2122~ = `r bn_good_2122`). The final number of responses used in analyses were: *n*~2023~ = `r length(bn_2223$bn)`; *n*~2122~ = `r length(bn_2122$bn)`. Prior to subsequent analyses, responses were converted to all lower case, punctuation was removed, and contractions were uncontracted (e.g., "i've" to "i have"), except words ending in "apostrophe s" (i.e., 's) because they have no straightforward uncontraction, as they could be some sort of contraction or could be possessive. Instances of 's were deleted.

##### Hierarchy of Needs

The `str_detect` function of the `stringr` package, which is part of the greater `tidyverse`, was used to identify word mentions, which were then counted to represent how many students wrote about need domains and financial, pay/wage, and unionization issues. Percentages were computed by dividing those numbers by the total number of usable responses and multiplying by 100.

The words "food" and "housing" represented physiological needs, some version of the word "safe" represented safety needs, some version of the word "belong" represented belonging needs, the word "esteem" represented esteem needs, and some version of the word "fulfill" represented fulfillment (or self-actualization) needs. A list of financially-related words was developed ("afford," "bills," "bucks," "buy," "bought," "cash," "cheap," "cost," "debt," "dollars," "econom," "expens," "fee," "financ," "fund," "gentrif," "scholarship," "spendy," "loan," "money," "overpriced," "paid," "pay," "poverty," "price," "stipend," "subsidi," "subsidy," "tuition," "tution[sic]," "wage"). The words "pay," "paid," and "wage" were specifically targeted within that list. And the word "union" was searched in 2023 data (unionization efforts were irrelevant prior to this wave). Instances that referred to the student union (i.e., the Erb Memorial Union) were subsequently discounted.

All of the above involved counting how many students mentioned words. We also counted how many times words were mentioned by first using the `tm` package to make a document-term matrix in which numbers and stop words were first removed and then words with no or very little descriptive utility were subsequently removed to allow more descriptively useful words to the top. Specifically, the following words were removed: also (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="also"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="also"]`), can (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="can"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="can"]`), get (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="get"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="get"]`), just (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="just"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="just"]`), know (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="know"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="know"]`), like (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="like"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="like"]`), lot (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="lot"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="lot"]`), make (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="make"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="make"]`), many (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="many"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="many"]`), much (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="much"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="much"]`), need(s) (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="needs"]+bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="need"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="needs"]+bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="need"]`), and think (freq~2023~ = `r bn_dtm_2223$freq[bn_dtm_2223$word=="think"]`; freq~2022~ = `r bn_dtm_2122$freq[bn_dtm_2122$word=="think"]`).

##### Content Analysis

###### Themes

Responses were open-coded using Grounded Theory ([Strauss & Corbin, 2006](https://www.abebooks.com/Basics-Qualitative-Research-Grounded-Theory-Procedures/31086127519/bd); [Tracy, 2019](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Qualitative+Research+Methods%3A+Collecting+Evidence%2C+Crafting+Analysis%2C+Communicating+Impact%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119390800)), which is a framework used to understand people’s experiences by building on themes from qualitative data they provide.

###### Wordnet

The `udpipe` package was used to annotate parts of speech prior to analysis. Coocurrences of nouns and adjectives (skipgram = 1) were computed using the `cooccurrence` function of the `udpipe` package. Coocurrences were visualized using the `igraph` and `ggraph` packages, imposing a minimum coocurrence threshold of 3.

###### Wordcloud

The `udpipe` package was used to annotate parts of speech prior to analysis and to extract keywords using the Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm ([Rose et al., 2010](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/Eda0fgvF1VJAn2PPEU3c0xIBTrkNJIEnzOUzQhz6zaT5IA?e=FeHDYB){target="_blank"}). Keywords were visualized using the `wordcloud2` package, imposing a minimum occurrence threshold of 3.

###### Quotes

Direct quotes were selected (and silently edited for clarity) to represent take-home messages represented in themes, wordnets, or wordclouds. 

##### Sentiment Analysis 

The `tidytext` package was used to classify valence (positive, negative) and specific emotion (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust) of sentiments. Three lexicons were used to classify valence of sentiments: `afinn` ([Nielsen, 2011](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2903){target="_blank"}), `bing` ([Hu & Liu, 2004 ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1014052.1014073){target="_blank"}), and `nrc` ([Mohammad & Turney, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6297.pdf){target="_blank"}). The `nrc` lexicon was also used to classify emotions. Emotion classification is based on [Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion](https://doi.org/10.1177/053901882021004003){target="_blank"}. Percentages were computed for valence (by method) and emotion. Nothing was done to deal with negation (e.g., "not good" is negative).

### Housing Insecurity and Homelessness

The Hope Center Student Basic Needs Survey measures housing insecurity and homelessness using the following methods.

#### Implementation

<br>

**First, students were presented with the following instruction:**

<br>

Next, we have some questions about what your life is like outside of school and work.

<br>

**Then, students were presented with several items about their living situation. Items relevant to housing insecurity and homelessness indices are presented below.**

<br>

Which of the following have you experienced in the past 12 months? (Please check all that apply.)

* <span style="color:#0A6EBD">Been unable to pay or underpaid rent or mortgage</span> (1pt)
* Been evicted from your home 
* <span style="color:#0A6EBD">Received a summons to appear in housing court</span> (1pt)
